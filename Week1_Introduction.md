# Week 1 – Introduction to Embedded System Design

• An embedded system is a combination of hardware and software designed to perform a specific dedicated function.
• Unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are optimized for cost, power consumption, and real-time operation.  
• Embedded systems are widely used in everyday life such as washing machines, air conditioners, cars, medical devices, and consumer electronics.  
• Most embedded systems are built around a microcontroller, which integrates CPU, memory, and I/O peripherals on a single chip.  
• Embedded systems often operate under real-time constraints and are designed for reliability and correctness.  
• Embedded systems can be part of a larger product, such as ABS and airbag systems in automobiles.  
• Embedded systems are closely related to fields like IoT, cyber-physical systems, and physical computing.  
• A modular design approach helps in understanding embedded systems by dividing them into functional blocks.
