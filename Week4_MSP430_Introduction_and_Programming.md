# Week 4 – MSP430 Introduction, Architecture & Programming Methods
(NPTEL – Embedded System Design)

• MSP430 is a low-power 16-bit microcontroller family developed by Texas Instruments.

• MSP stands for Mixed Signal Processor because it integrates digital CPU with analog peripherals.

• MSP430 is mainly used in low-power sensing, measurement, and control applications.

• It follows Von-Neumann architecture where program and data share the same memory space.

• MSP430 CPU is a RISC processor with 16-bit registers and 16-bit data bus.

• MSP430 has multiple low-power operating modes to reduce power consumption.

• The CPU contains Program Counter (PC), Stack Pointer (SP), Status Register (SR), and general-purpose registers.

• Flash memory is used for program storage and RAM is used for data storage.

• Peripheral registers are memory-mapped and accessed like normal memory locations.

• MSP430 instruction set includes double-operand, single-operand, and jump instructions.

• Various addressing modes such as register, indexed, immediate, indirect, and absolute are supported.

• Programming of MSP430 can be done using Embedded C or Assembly language.

• Common development tools include Code Composer Studio (CCS), IAR Embedded Workbench, and Energia IDE.

• Program downloading and debugging can be done using JTAG or Spy-Bi-Wire interface.

• MSP430 LaunchPad (development board) is used to write, load, and test programs.

• MSP430 supports UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, timers, and comparator peripherals.
