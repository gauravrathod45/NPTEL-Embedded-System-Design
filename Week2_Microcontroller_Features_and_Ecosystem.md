# Week 2 – Microcontroller Features and Embedded System Ecosystem
(NPTEL – Embedded System Design)

• Expected functions from a microcontroller include reading digital inputs, providing digital outputs, and responding to interrupts.

• Microcontrollers integrate CPU, memory, I/O pins, and peripherals on a single chip.

• CPU can be 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit and may follow RISC or CISC architecture.

• Memory types include Flash/ROM for program storage, RAM for data storage, and EEPROM for semi-permanent data.

• Modern microcontrollers include peripherals such as timers, counters, PWM generators, ADC, and watchdog timers.

• I/O pins are programmable and can support multiple alternate functions.

• Some functions like UART, SPI, or I2C may be available on multiple pins.

• Application development requires tools such as cross-compilers, simulators, debuggers, and evaluation boards.

• Embedded system ecosystem includes hardware, software, development tools, and testing facilities.

• Clock, reset, power supply, and program download capability are essential elements of a microcontroller system.
